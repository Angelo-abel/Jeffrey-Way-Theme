## Update
This should be much easier to install now. Please follow the directions below.

### Directions
+ Download the zip of this project and rename the folder to `Jeffrey Way Theme`.
+ In Sublime, go to **Preferences > Browse Packages** and move the `Jeffrey Way Theme` folder to that location.
+ Go to **Preferences > Settings-User** and change the following settings to this: 

```json
"color_scheme": "Packages/Jeffrey Way Theme/schemes/Facebook.tmTheme",
"theme": "Material-Theme.sublime-theme",
```

You should be good from here. Let me know if issues arise.
